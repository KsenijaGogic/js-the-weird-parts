### Conceptual Aside
1. Syntax Parser
"A program that reads your code, determines what it does, and if its grammar is valid." 
Programs such as compilers and interpreters that do the process/work of reading your code, and then converts it to something the computer can understand and inerpret. *It's important to note that these intermediate programs affect how your code executes.*

2. Lexical Environments
"Where something sits physically in the code you write."
Lexical -> to do with words or grammar. "A lexical environment exists in programming languages in which *where* you write something is important. We're talking about where something sits, what's around it. That's important." 

3. Execution Contexts
"A wrapper to help manage the code that is running." Within the many lexical environments in your code, the execution context is what determines what is actually running. An execution context contains your code, but also beyond it.

*"Just remember. It's important," _he says._*
